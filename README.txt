1. If you're getting captchas on the joiner and the captcha response says 'Token M**** was captched You need to update your app to join this server.'

Then what you want to do is head on over to google chrome, login using the token and join a random server and solve the captcha it gives you, after you've joined it, the error will be fixed. It's annoying, but that's how it is if 
you don't want to spend $2,000 on a hcaptcha solver, or just buy discord nitro tokens, Have fun!
